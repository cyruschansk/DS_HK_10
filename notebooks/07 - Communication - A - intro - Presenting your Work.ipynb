As data scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers faced with fulfilling business objectives, we find ourselves bridging the gap between two cultures: sciences and humanities. After spending countless hours in a Jupyter notebook devising a creative and elegant solution to a difficult problem, the insights and business applications are obvious in our minds. But how do you distill them into something you can communicate?"
